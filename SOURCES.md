# Data sources

Written by `scripts/build_dataset.py` from the same build as the figures, so the two always match.

## Which countries are ranked

186 countries are ranked. A country needs at least 20 of the 34 indicators to be ranked. Figures from before 2015 are left out, and nothing is imputed: a country a source does not cover has no value for it.

## How each indicator is scored

Each indicator is rescaled to a score from 0 to 100 between two goalposts, set at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the countries' values (on a log scale for skewed figures such as income), and turned round where a lower value is better. A value beyond a goalpost scores 0 or 100. A country's world rank on an indicator uses its value, not its score, so values beyond the goalposts still rank in order. A dimension's score is the average of the indicator scores a country has in it; if the country has fewer than half of them, the dimension is n/a and the overall score is the average of the other dimensions.

V-Dem's freedom-of-religion score is averaged over its last three years (2023 to 2025), because it rests on a single question rated by a handful of experts per country and moves a lot from year to year. It is the only averaged value.

The files as downloaded from each publisher are kept in `data/sources/`; `scripts/fetch_sources.sh` downloads them again.

## The indicators

Grouped by dimension. "Lower is better" marks an indicator turned round for scoring. The goalposts are the values that score 0 and 100, in the publisher's units.

## Considered and left out

- **Global Terrorism Index (IEP)**: terrorism is already one of the 23 indicators in the Global Peace Index, and more than half of countries score exactly 0.
- **International Property Rights Index**: published by an advocacy group, and largely repeats the World Bank's rule-of-law measure.
- **ITUC Global Rights Index**: its website was offline when this dataset was built. The ILO's SDG indicator 8.8.2 was also left out, because the ILO says it "is not intended as a tool to compare compliance among ILO member States".
- **Housing affordability, access to public transport and the KidsRights Index**: no source covers most countries.
- **Taiwan, Kosovo, Monaco, Liechtenstein and other small states** are shown but not ranked: the UN-system sources (the World Bank, WHO and UNDP) do not report them, which leaves them short of the minimum number of indicators.
