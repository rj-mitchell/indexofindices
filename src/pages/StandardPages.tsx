      others publish: the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the UN Development Programme, Transparency
      International, Reporters Without Borders, V-Dem, the Institute for Economics and Peace, Yale, Notre Dame, Ookla
      and others. You choose how much each of eight dimensions counts, and the map and the rankings follow.

      It collects no figures of its own. It rescales each publisher's figures to a common 0 to 100 scale, averages
      them within each dimension, and weights the dimensions as you set them. <Link href="/method">How it works</Link>{' '}

    <h2>Who runs it</h2>
    <p>
      Where Lives Stand is a project of <a href={HUB_URL}>Where They Stand</a>, which is applying to register as a
      charity in England and Wales. Until it is registered, the site is run by its founder, Rob Mitchell; once it is
      registered, the charity will run it. Until 6 November 2026 the site was called the Index of Indices.

    <h2>Linking to a country</h2>
    <p>
      Every country has its own address: <code>{SITE_URL}/country/</code> followed by its three-letter ISO 3166 code,
      such as <a href="/country/GBR">{SITE_URL}/country/GBR</a> for the United Kingdom. Weights, regions and
      comparisons can be shared too: the address bar always holds the current view.

    <h2>Licence</h2>
    <p>
      The code is open source under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0, at <a href={REPO_URL}>GitHub</a>, and
      the site's own text is under CC BY 4.0. The figures are not covered by either licence: each belongs to its
      publisher and is used under the publisher's terms. See the <Link href="/terms">terms of use</Link>.

  <Page title="How it works" kicker="Method and sources">
    <p className="text-lg">
      How the figures are chosen, scored and combined, and where each comes from. The rest of this page is generated
      with the dataset itself, from the same build that produces the figures (<a href={SOURCES_URL}>SOURCES.md</a>),
      and was last rebuilt on {formatDate(DATA_UPDATED)}.
    </p>
    <h2>The overall score</h2>
    <p>
      Each country's overall score is the weighted average of its eight dimension scores, using the weights you set
      (all 50% to begin with). A dimension a country lacks is left out, and the others share its weight. If you weight
      the indicators separately, each dimension becomes the weighted average of its indicators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strengths and weaknesses in a country's dossier are the indicators with the most pull on its score: how far
      its world rank on each sits above or below the middle, times the share of the overall score that indicator
      carries under your weights. An indicator you weight at zero is never among them.
    </p>
    <h2>The colour scale</h2>
    <p>
      The map uses one hue, heather, from pale to dark (light to bright in dark mode), so the order can be read from
      lightness alone, whatever a reader's colour vision. On the world scale, 20 or less is the palest and 90 or more
      the darkest. In a region you can stretch the scale over that region's own range. The legend is drawn from the
      same scale as the map. The map uses the Mercator projection, so that smaller countries are large enough to see and
      select; it makes countries far from the equator look bigger than they are, and Antarctica, Greenland and the
      far-northern Arctic islands are left off it for that reason.

      The short version: use it freely, check the sources, and credit the site if you reuse its work.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted">Last updated {formatDate(TERMS_UPDATED)}.</p>
    <h2>About these terms</h2>
    <p>
      Where Lives Stand (wherelivesstand.com) is a Where They Stand project. Where They Stand is applying to register as
      a charity in England and Wales. Until it is registered, the site is run by its founder, Rob Mitchell; once it is
      registered, the charity will run it. By using the site you agree to these terms. Contact: <Email />.
    </p>
    <h2>What the site is, and is not</h2>
    <p>
      The site shows figures published by others, such as the World Bank, the World Health Organization and the UN
      Development Programme, rescales them to a common scale and combines them under the weights you choose. Every
      figure carries its year and links to its publisher. Always check the source before relying on a figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scores and ranks are this site's arithmetic on those figures, not an official ranking by any publisher. They
      are general information, not advice on where to live, work, invest or travel.

    <p>{INDEPENDENCE_LINE}</p>
    <p>The service is free and provided "as is". It may change, be paused or stop.</p>

      <li>
        Each indicator's figures belong to its publisher and are used under that publisher's terms.{' '}
        <Link href="/method">How it works</Link> names the publisher of each indicator and links to its source (the

    <h2>Fair use of the service</h2>
    <p>
      Please don't send automated requests in bulk: every figure is in the <a href={REPO_URL}>repository</a>. Please
      don't try to break, overload or gain unauthorised access to the site, or present its figures as saying something

    <h2>Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Every effort is made to keep the site accurate and fair, and our mistakes are corrected when found and listed on

      correct or up to date. To the extent the law allows, Where They Stand is not liable for any loss arising from use

    <h2>What you can do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the whole site with a keyboard. On the map, each country is a stop with its name and score; Enter opens its dossier. A link before the map skips straight to the table.</li>
      <li>Read every figure on the map in the table of rankings below it, which you can sort by any column.</li>
      <li>Close a dossier or the comparison with Escape; focus returns to where you were.</li>
      <li>Read the map whatever your colour vision: the scale runs from pale to dark in one hue.</li>
      <li>Zoom the page to 200% and more, and use dark mode, which the site follows from your system.</li>
      <li>Copy any figure, name or source from the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How we tested it</h2>
    <p>
      On {formatDate(ACCESSIBILITY_CHECKED)} we checked the site with a keyboard alone, at phone and desktop widths, in
      light and dark mode, with reduced motion, and against the colour-contrast and colour-vision checks for the map
      scale. We have not yet tested it with screen-reader users or with an independent audit.
    </p>
    <h2>Known limits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The map has about two hundred keyboard stops, one per country. Use the skip link, the search box or the table to go straight to a country.</li>
      <li>The small territories and islands on the map are hard to hover or tap; they are all in the table and the search.</li>
      <li>The site needs JavaScript to work out the scores. Without it you see only the page titles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Problems and feedback</h2>
    <p>
      If something does not work for you, email <Email /> and say what you were trying to do. We aim to reply within
      five working days. If you are not happy with our reply, you can contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service
      (EASS).
